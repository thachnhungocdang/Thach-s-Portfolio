## Insights summary
- **Late deliveries** average 6.77%. While not extreme, they significantly reduce customer ratings, especially in peak periods.  
- **One-time buyers dominate** (~95%). Very few customers are loyal or repeat buyers.  
- **Low ratings (1–2 stars)**: over 60% are linked to late or undelivered orders. Categories like **Bed Bath Table** and **Health Beauty** show the highest concentration of bad reviews.  
- **Voucher payment** has high risk: cancellation rate 2.43%, higher than credit/debit cards (~0.5%).  

## Recommended actions
- Build a simple brand site for direct retention and remarketing
- Prioritise SLA for high distance routes and peak months
- Improve product pages – clearer descriptions and realistic photos.
- Audit logistics partners; prioritize reliable couriers.  
- Add real-time alerts for orders at risk of delays. 
- Focus on growing **Health & Beauty** and **Watches & Gifts** to increase order value.
